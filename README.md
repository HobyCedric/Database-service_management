# Database-service_management

This Microsoft Access database was developed in August 2018 to streamline service management processes within a pool building company. Designed to facilitate efficient service scheduling, tracking, and reporting, the database utilizes SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval.

Key Features:

Service Request Management: The database allows the company to log and track service requests from customers. Each request is assigned a unique identifier and includes essential details such as customer information, service type, and location.

Resource Allocation: Service technicians and resources are efficiently allocated based on service requests. The system helps in assigning the right personnel and equipment to ensure timely service delivery.

Scheduling and Calendar Integration: An integrated calendar system helps schedule service appointments and avoid conflicts. It also provides a visual representation of service appointments for better planning.

Inventory Management: The database includes inventory management functionality, enabling the company to keep track of spare parts and supplies needed for service calls. It helps in maintaining an optimal inventory level and avoids delays in service due to unavailability of parts.

Service History: Detailed service records are maintained for each customer, including past service requests, solutions applied, and any follow-up actions required. This historical data assists in providing a better customer experience.

Reporting and Analytics: SQL queries are employed for generating custom reports and analytics, providing insights into service performance, resource utilization, and customer satisfaction. These reports aid in making informed decisions to improve service efficiency.

Compatibility: Please note that the database may exhibit some instability issues depending on the version of Microsoft Access used to open it. Due to its creation in August 2018, compatibility issues may arise when opening it with newer versions of Access. It's recommended to ensure compatibility or consider migrating to a more stable database platform if needed.
